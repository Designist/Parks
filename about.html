              <p><b>Welcome to the 100 Missouri Miles Challenge!</b> The First Lady and I are excited to take this journey for the third time. When we launched the 100 Missouri Miles Challenge in to celebrate Missouri’s distinction as the “Best Trails State” in America, it was as a way to promote the health benefits of outdoor physical activity. As we head into the third year of the challenge, we are so proud of what our participants have accomplished.</p>
              <p>From the beginning, the response from Missourians all across the state was overwhelming, as Missourians logged over 1.1 million miles on Missouri trails in 2013. They nearly doubled that in 2014 by notching 2.1 million miles, pushing our total to over 3,000,000 total miles over the first two years of the challenge.  From cities and suburbs to our small towns and rural areas, Missourians have tackled this challenge as an opportunity to get active and healthy, while enjoying Missouri’s beautiful outdoors.</p>
              <p>This year, the First Lady and I are encouraging Missouri families to join us as we take advantage of the  award-winning trails and waterways found throughout the Show-Me State during the 2015 Governor’s 100 Missouri Miles Challenge.</p>
              <p>Once again, we are challenging Missourians to complete “100 Missouri Miles” of physical activity by the end of the year. Whether you run, walk, bike, paddle, swim or roll, everyone can participate.  This initiative is a great opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, improve your health and – best of all – have fun with family and friends.</p>
              <p>Please continue to visit www.MO.gov or www.100missourimiles.com for forthcoming details, announcements and updates to this year’s challenge. Remember, the great thing about the 100 Missouri Miles Challenge is that you can choose your own path. From urban greenways to back country hiking trails, Missouri’s trails offer something for all ages, interests and ability levels.</p>
